# Bicycle Workshop

Sample application from [Full-scale CUBA application: Step by Step Guide](https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-workshop/wiki) tutorial.

The Workshop application is a simple order management system that enables tracking orders made by clients. Each order contains information about client, mechanic, spare parts used and services provided. Clients, mechanics, spare parts and orders can be created, edited and deleted through the system user interface.

This sample covers basic and most used features of the CUBA Platform, including development approach and runtime features of the platform.
